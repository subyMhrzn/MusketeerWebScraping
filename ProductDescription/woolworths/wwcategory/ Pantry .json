Each morning for 19 years Joseph and Edward Tetley loaded a packhorse with their finest tea and peddled it until the Yorkshire sun set. How did they (and the horse) do it for so long? We have no idea.Finally they set up shop in London. The horse was gone but the Tetley spirit remained: one part pragmatic attitude, an equal measure of working class roots and a generous spoonful of 'stiff upper lip'.There you have it.

At Continental, we’ve always prided ourselves on the quality of what we produce, from sourcing the best quality ingredients to putting passionate and talented chefs in our kitchens.

Full-bodied with just the right consistency, it's suitable for rich recipes with meat or green sauces like Pesto but can also be served cold as part of a salad with high-quality olive oil. Use it to give your tuna salad an update or make a delicious Sicilian Fusilli with anchovies, eggplant, olives, chilli and more. Part of our Classic Blue Box range, which means perfect, quality \"\"al dente\"\" pasta every time, our Fusilli cooks in just 11 minutes. Simply bring water to a boil in a large pot, add the Fusilli, and a generous pinch of rock salt to the cooking water to enhance the pasta's flavour. For authentic \"\"al dente\"\" pasta, boil uncovered, stirring occasionally for 11 minutes. Drain well and serve immediately with your favourite Barilla sauce. With a variety of shapes in our line of traditional semolina pasta, you're sure to find the perfect pasta for any recipe. From our short pasta like Blue Box Farfalle or Penne Rigate to long pasta such as Blue Box Linguine or Spaghetti, you're guaranteed to always get a perfect \"al dente\" bite.

As history unfolded, it was the Billy Tea version that made the ditty famous! Banjo wrote this acclaimed poem at the Dagworth Homestead, a bush station in Queensland in 1895, a few years after the Billy Tea Company was established.Where does the word 'Billy' come from? Well, it's said that the word was originally derived from the French word 'bouilli' - pronounced 'boo-illi'  after a brand of imported tinned beef soup that was a staple food item consumed by Aussie diggers during the historic gold rush days. They would attach a wire handle to the empty tins and use this to boil water for tea.

With the roasting bag and all of the herbs and spices included, all you need to add is chicken and some fresh veggies to create a fuss-free, delicious roast meal. At Continental, we love food the way you do. We know how much you value good, nutritious, flavourful food, as well as authentic home cooking. It feels good to cook, and even better to bring pleasure to the ones you love, through the food you put on the table. How we preserve and lock in flavour in our products is just as important as how we grow our vegetables in the first place. That can mean drying, freezing, boiling, or turning them into paste – whatever suits the Continental recipe they’ll be making. Drying is one of the oldest ways to preserve food there is, going back thousands of years. It’s simple, safe and helps keep the colour, aroma and flavour of our ingredients for longer - naturally. We don’t need to add any preservatives, and it protects the natural flavour. For over 50 years now, our chefs at Continental have combined their expertise, love of flavour, and only the finest ingredients to help you create great tasting meals every day.Go to http:continental.com.au to find more recipe inspirations and additional flavours such as sheperds pie, curried sausages, spaghetti Bolognese, beef stroganoff, chicken curry, beef stew, chicken risotto, swedish meatballs, chicken korma and many more instant sauces.Have dinner ready in 3 easy steps - make it, shake it, bake it.Roasting Bag IncludedNo added MSGServes 4Made in AustraliaJust add 1 ingredient for Honey Bbq Chicken","wwItemIngredients":"Ingredients: Maltodextrin, corn starch, sugar, natural flavours (contain wheat and milk), salt, garlic, mustard flour, vegetable oil, vegetable gum (xanthan), spices (ginger, paprika, chilli, cayenne pepper), burnt sugar, food acid (citric), natural colours (turmeric, carotene, carmine).

So great did they see this threat, that they sent a Warlord to every village to confiscate all the people's weapons. This act resulted in exactly what the Mongolians had feared - a plan of revolt. The Chinese chose the 15th of August as the day the uprising would commence and, under the guise of celebrating harvest, cakes were sent around to all the people. Inside the 'Moon' cakes was a message indicating the time the revolt would take place.

On the slopes of a primeval forest, the monks discovered and cultivated a rare fruit, prized for its sweetness. This sacred fruit was named Monk Fruit, or Luo Han Guo, after its devoted caretakers and was used in elixirs to raise chi, or life energy. We still grow and harvest Monk Fruit for Lakanto in the same pristine area, according to traditional and environmentally-friendly methods. Cooks, bakes and tastes just like sugar! 1:1 Sugar Replacement Measures & Sweetens Spoon-for-spoon like Sugar! Lakanto is natural in taste and texture - just like real sugar. Its sweetness profile is nearly identical to that of sugar. Being heat stable makes it suitable for beverages, cooking, and baking. With Lakanto, you can now enjoy your favourite foods and drinks - without feeling guilty! We formulated our own proprietary mixture of high-purity Monk Fruit extract and non-GMO Erythritol to be the best and closest substitute for sugar. Neither Monk Fruit, nor Erythritol can match the sweetness of sugar by themselves. Monk Fruit is 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, while Erythritol is only 70% as sweet. Our special recipe combines the two ingredients to provide a healthy alternative that's spoon-for-spoon as sweet as sugar without the calories! Monk fruit is the key ingredient. Lakanto is a pleasant tasting and versatile natural sweetener. Erythritol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol found in some fruits, vegetables and fermented foods. Product is vegan friendly and contains no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives.
