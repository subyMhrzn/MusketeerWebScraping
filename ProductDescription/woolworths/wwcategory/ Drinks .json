Banjo wrote this acclaimed poem at the Dagworth Homestead, a bush station in Queensland in 1895, a few years after the Billy Tea Company was established.Where does the word 'Billy' come from? Well, it's said that the word was originally derived from the French word 'bouilli' - pronounced 'boo-illi'  after a brand of imported tinned beef soup that was a staple food item consumed by Aussie diggers during the historic gold rush days. They would attach a wire handle to the empty tins and use this to boil water for tea.
