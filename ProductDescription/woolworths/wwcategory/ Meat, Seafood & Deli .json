Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled.

An increased amount of cream in the finished cheese makes for a well-balanced acidity and decadent texture, perfect to serve with Maggie's Quince or Spiced Pear Paste.Maggie's tips for a perfect platter:1. Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled. All that's left is to open a bottle of your favourite wine or non-alcoholic, sit back and enjoy!  - Australian owned- Australian made- 100% Australian milk & cream","wwItemIngredients":"Pasteurised Milk (min. 14.0% Cream), Salt, Starter Cultures, Non-Animal Rennet"},{"wwItemTitle":"Chris' Heritage Dips Vintage Cheddar & Caramelised Onion Cheese 170g","wwItemDetails":"Chri's Heritage Dips with Vintage Cheddar cheese and Basalmic Caramelised Onions- Australian dairy product competition 2015 - Silver.- Packing is used by terracotta.","wwItemIngredients":"Cream Cheese [Milk, Cream, Milk Solids Non Fat, Salt, Vegetable Gum (410), Food Acid (270), Starter Culture], Vintage Cheddar (17%) [Milk, Salt, Mineral Salt (509), Starter Culture, Animal Rennet, Preservatives (202, 221)], Caramelised Onion (12%) [Onion (80%), Canola Oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Olive Oil, Sugar, Salt, Cultured Dextrose], Cream [Cream, Mineral Salts (450, 500), Thickener (400)], Mayonnaise [Canola Oil, Water, Vinegar, Egg, Salt, Sugar, Vegetable Gums (415, 401), Stabiliser (331), Lemon Juice], Yoghurt [Milk, Milk Solids, Skim Milk, Cream, Cultures], Canola Oil, Food Acid (330), Preservatives (202, 211), Dextrose, Vegetable Gums (417, 415), Enclosed Sachet Ingredient: Black Pepper"},{"wwItemTitle":"Woolworths Cook Butterflied Lamb Leg With Honey & Rosemary 400g - 700g","wwItemDetails":"Meltingly tender Australian lamb is combined with the sweet and fragrant flavours of honey and rosemary, for a mouthwatering lamb leg roast thatâ€™s prepped and ready to cook.
