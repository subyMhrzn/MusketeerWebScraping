He would then sell these to neighbours along with sweets, cakes and lemonade. Popularity grew, and he soon used a cart, then a one horsepower motorbike, to sell Streets Ice Cream. It continued to grow and today Streets ice cream is sold throughout Australia and New Zealand with brands such as Magnum, Viennetta, Paddle Pop, Cornetto, Gaytime, Calippo and Blue Ribbon.

Golden Gaytime is renowned for its iconic combination of toffee and vanilla flavoured ice cream, dipped in scrumptious chocolate and covered in delicious biscuit pieces. Between World War 1 and World War 2, Edwin (‘Ted’) Street with the help of his wife and brother laid the foundations (in Corrimal, NSW) for what would ultimately become Australia’s biggest and best-known ice cream manufacturer. Streets ice cream was originally made in the back shed by Ted Street. He would then sell these to neighbours along with sweets, cakes and lemonade. Popularity grew, and he soon used a cart, then a one horsepower motorbike, to sell Streets ice cream. It continued to grow and today Streets ice cream is sold throughout Australia and New Zealand with well-known brands such as Magnum, Paddle Pop, Cornetto, Gaytime, Calippo and Blue Ribbon. Gaytime was first made in 1959, although it wasn’t until 1970 that the Golden Gaytime was released, becoming an Aussie icon in the process.The iconic toffee and vanilla flavour combination you love, swirled together with delicious biscuit pieces now in a BITE!The perfect snack for any occasion!

Vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream with cookie dough and fudge brownies—it’s hard to imagine a better combination. Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked—which got its name because the cookie dough isn’t baked, but the brownies are—has been a bestselling flavour since we first decided to combine our classic homemade ice cream creations back in 2000.  Cookie Dough, with big chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by vanilla ice cream, was created back in 1984 at our very first Scoop Shop after we received an anonymous flavour suggestion. It continues as a flavour phenomenon to this very day. Chocolate Fudge Brownie is a fan-favourite chocolate extravaganza, mixing chocolate ice cream with ridiculously delicious Greyston Bakery brownies. It’s been satisfying chocolate lovers since 1991. We know it can be hard to choose between those two legendary flavours. With Half Baked, you don’t have to! We work with Fairtrade-certified producers for all the cocoa, sugar, and vanilla in our recipes. Our Caring Dairy farmers produce all the kosher-certified milk and cream in a sustainable way. Greyston Bakery, one of the largest social enterprises in the USA, provides the sumptuous brownies for this and all of our frozen dessert flavours. All our ice cream is made with non-GMO-sourced ingredients and cage-free eggs.
