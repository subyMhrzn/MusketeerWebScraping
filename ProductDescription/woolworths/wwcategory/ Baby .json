Accidents have occurred when babies have been left alone with drinking equipment due to the baby falling or if the product has disassembled.Never use feeding teats/nipples (delete as appropriate) as a soother/pacifier (delete as appropriate).

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Night time soother. Our Night time soothers feature ingenious glow in the dark handles, so parents can locate the soother in a dark room without having to disturb baby. Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.  Our orthodontic* Night time soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby’s developing teeth and gums.  The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no ‘wrong’ side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby’s mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby’s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby’s delicate skin against irritation. The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard. *as compared to traditional round unvented soothers which do not compress as easily. **From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 mums with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee soother: **99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother  **97% of mums say a Tommee Tippee soother helped settle baby  **93% of mums say babies love their Tommee Tippee soother **97.5% accept a Tommee Tippee sootherSymmetrical orthodontic* design: The Tommee Tippee night time soother features a symmetrical silicone teat and with no ‘wrong’ side up, it will always be placed correctly in baby’s mouth Acceptance guaranteed: Accepted by 97.5% of babies**, the 100% medical-grade, BPA-free silicone teat is soft, flexible but extremely durable and won’t absorb stains and odours Mum recommended: Loved by mums and babies, our night time dummies help to settle baby, with 99% of mums reporting they would recommend our soothers to others** Kind on baby’s skin: The curved shield ensures a comfortable fit between baby’s nose and chin and the large holes allow extra air flow and prevent moisture build-up to help prevent skin irritation Glow in the dark handle: The glow in the dark handle allows parents to locate the soother in a dark room without having to disturb baby","wwItemIngredients":"WARNING! Inspect carefully before each use. Pull the soother in all directions. Throw away at the first signs of damage or weakness Only use dedicated soother holders tested to EN 12586.

Pins, ribbons or string shall not be attached to any part of the dummy (I.e. around the ring, plug or through the ventilation holes) as these can be strangulation hazards. Strangulation hazards include the cutting off of blood supply to fingers and limbs.

The symmetrical, silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no ‘wrong’ side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby’s mouth. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby’s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby’s delicate skin against irritation.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Fun Style soother. Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.  Our orthodontic* Fun Style soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby’s developing teeth and gums.  The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no ‘wrong’ side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby’s mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby’s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby’s delicate skin against irritation. The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard. *as compared to traditional round unvented soothers which do not compress as easily. **From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 mums with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee soother: **99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother  **97% of mums say a Tommee Tippee soother helped settle baby  **93% of mums say babies love their Tommee Tippee soother **97.5% accept a Tommee Tippee sootherSymmetrical orthodontic* design: The Tommee Tippee Fun Style soother features a symmetrical silicone teat and with no ‘wrong’ side up, it will always be placed correctly in baby’s mouth Reusable steriliser pod: Pop in the microwave to quickly sterilise your soothers and kill up to 99.9% of bacteria.

Inspect carefully before each use. Pull the soother in all directions. Throw away at the first signs of damage or weakness Only use dedicated soother holders tested to EN 12586. Never attach other ribbons or cords to a soother, your child may be strangled by them. Decorations shall not be added to dummies as they may detach and the child could choke on them. Pins, ribbons or string shall not be attached to any part of the dummy (I.e. around the ring, plug or through the ventilation holes) as these can be strangulation hazards. Strangulation hazards include the cutting off of blood supply to fingers and limbs. In the event that the dummy becomes lodged in the mouth, DO NOT PANIC; it cannot be swallowed and is designed to cope with such an event.  Remove from the mouth with care and as gently as possible.
