This was on full display during his team's glorious 2012 premiership win. Playing through a torn knee ligament, Adam fought through the pain and stood up when it counted for his team, kicking a much needed goal in the dying minutes of the match. A Cheer & A HalfFor Being a LegendAustralian cricket legend Mark Taylor ended the 2nd day of a 5-Day test against Pakistan with 334 runs not out, tying with Don Bradman's Australian record. Leading Pakistan before the third day, Mark decided to declare alongside Don's record, instead of surpassing him, showing respect to the all-time great of the game. A Cheer & A HalfFor Being a MateRunning alongside a fellow Aussie in the last event of the 2020 Olympic Decathlon, Cedric Dubler realised his teammate was off pace in the closing stages of the 1500M. He needed to stay in touch with the runners ahead to secure enough points for a bronze medal. Cedric, knowing that he himself couldn't place, instead decided to cheer on his mate to a bronze medal finish. A Cheer & A HalfFor PurposeAs the first Australian rugby team left for the UK in 1908, the British press nicknamed them 'The Rabbits'. The men gave themselves a different name, 'The Wallabies' - for their purpose would be to never take a backward step. They defeated England 9-3 and The Wallabies legacy was forged and preserved by all who wear the iconic gold jersey. A Cheer & A HalfFor RespectDaisy Pearce is one of the most respected pioneers of women's football. Along with being an exceptional captain and expert commentator, Daisy is a mum to twins and the first active player to return to top level women's football post pregnancy, paving the way for other women to do the same. A Cheer & A HalfFor A SportsmanSimon Clarke is one of Australia's greatest cyclists and sportsmen. In 2015, Clarke was behind a fellow Aussie competing in the final stretch of a road race when he noticed their tyre was punctured. Even though they were on different teams, Clarke rushed to his countryman's aid, giving him his own spare wheel to help him finish the race. A Cheer & A HalfFor Team SpiritDuring the 2020 Olympics, the Matildas decided to make one small change when walking on the field in the ultimate act of team spirit. Competing teams would normally pose with their nation's flag. The Matildas instead decided to display the Aboriginal flag as a sign of unity across the country. A Cheer & A HalfFor CourageSam Bloom is one of Australia's most accomplished surfers. After falling from a balcony, Sam tragically shattered her spine, leaving her paralysed from the chest down. A testament to how far courage can take you, Sam rehabilitated herself and went on to become a 2x world and Australian Para Surfing champion, inspiring all Australians to never give up. Join us in cheering on your heroes both on & off the field by heading to our website today https:www.cadburycheerandahalf.com.au","wwItemIngredients":"Full Cream Milk, Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Cocoa Mass, Milk Solids, Emulsifiers (Soy Lecithin, 476), Flavours."},{"wwItemTitle":"Tic Tac Orange 24g","wwItemDetails":"Tic Tac Orange Flavoured MintsRefresh every little moment with Tic Tac Orange Mints, delivering freshness in 2 calories!
