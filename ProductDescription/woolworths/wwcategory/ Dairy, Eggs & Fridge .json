It all started when I moved to the US from my home in Iceland and found the yoghurt on the shelves there too sweet. I wanted subtle flavour and less sugar. I really missed the thickness of skyr, the yoghurt from my home, Iceland, where skyr is as traditional as pavlova in Australia. I was mad about skyr growing up. So in 2004 I started making it in my apartment in New York. After some gruesome trial and error, it started to taste quite delicious. It has been so successful in the US that I decided to bring it to Australia. skyr, that's Icelandic for thick yoghurt! (pronounced \"skeer\") A rather old tradition Skyr has been a staple of the Icelandic diet for more than 1,000 years. It is a thick yoghurt made from cow's milk. Traditionally, skyr is made from the skim milk after the cream has been floated off to make butter. Like milk, regular yoghurt is mostly water, but with skyr, that water is removed which concentrates the milk. In other words, one cup of Siggi's skyr requires 2.5 times more milk than a regular cup of yoghurt. Not so much sugarMainstream yoghurt can have up to 25g of sugar per serving. My flavoured varieties have an average of 10-12 and are sweetened with fruit and a touch of cane sugar. I would like to add that we absolutely do not use any artificial sweeteners such as aspartame.I keep things simpleI do not use any preservatives, thickeners, artificial colours or flavours.Thank you,Siggi- All natural- No stevia- No aspartame- No sucralose- No gelatin- No artificial colours- No preservatives- No high fructose corn syrupHigh Protein120 caloriesAll NaturalNo Stevia","wwItemIngredients":"Skim milk, cream, milk solids, live yoghurt cultures.Live Active Cultures: S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis"},{"wwItemTitle":"Straight From The Farm 12 Cage Free Eggs 700g","wwItemDetails":"","wwItemIngredients":"null"},{"wwItemTitle":"Pauls Custard Pouch Strawberry 140g","wwItemDetails":"Enjoy snack time with Spiderman!

It all started when I moved to the US from my home in Iceland and found the yoghurt on the shelves there too sweet. I wanted subtle flavour and less sugar. I really missed the thickness of skyr, the yoghurt from my home, Iceland, where skyr is as traditional as pavlova in Australia. I was mad about skyr growing up. So in 2004 I started making it in my apartment in New York. After some gruesome trial and error, it started to taste quite delicious. It has been so successful in the US that I decided to bring it to Australia. skyr, that's Icelandic for thick yoghurt! (pronounced \"skeer\") A rather old tradition Skyr has been a staple of the Icelandic diet for more than 1,000 years. It is a thick yoghurt made from cow's milk. Traditionally, skyr is made from the skim milk after the cream has been floated off to make butter. Like milk, regular yoghurt is mostly water, but with skyr, that water is removed which concentrates the milk. In other words, one cup of Siggi's skyr requires 2.5 times more milk than a regular cup of yoghurt. Not so much sugarMainstream yoghurt can have up to 25g of sugar per serving. My flavoured varieties have an average of 10-12 and are sweetened with fruit and a touch of cane sugar. I would like to add that we absolutely do not use any artificial sweeteners such as aspartame.I keep things simpleI do not use any preservatives, thickeners, artificial colours or flavours.Thank you,Siggi- All natural- No stevia- No aspartame- No sucralose- No gelatin- No artificial colours- No preservatives- No high fructose corn syrupHigh Protein120 caloriesAll NaturalNo Stevia","wwItemIngredients":"Skim milk, cream, milk solids, live yoghurt cultures.Live Active Cultures: S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis"},{"wwItemTitle":"Pauls Custard Pouch Strawberry 140g","wwItemDetails":"Enjoy snack time with Spiderman!

Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled.

An increased amount of cream in the finished cheese makes for a well-balanced acidity and decadent texture, perfect to serve with Maggie's Quince or Spiced Pear Paste.Maggie's tips for a perfect platter:1. Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled. All that's left is to open a bottle of your favourite wine or non-alcoholic, sit back and enjoy!  - Australian owned- Australian made- 100% Australian milk & cream","wwItemIngredients":"Pasteurised Milk (min. 14.0% Cream), Salt, Starter Cultures, Non-Animal Rennet"},{"wwItemTitle":"Leggos Fresh Bolognese Sauce 250g","wwItemDetails":"Leggos Fresh Beef Bolognese Sauce with tomato  Italian herbs Serves 2 Ready in 3 mins No artificial colours or flavours","wwItemIngredients":"Diced tomato (28%), water, tomato paste (16%), beef (13%), onion (6%), carrot, olive oil, brown sugar, cornflour, parmesan cheese (contains milk), yeast extract, salt, garlic, herbs, food acid (citric), black pepper"},{"wwItemTitle":"Bega Original Cream Cheese Spreadable 225g","wwItemDetails":"Bega Cream Cheese Spreadable Original is proudly Aussie made & owned.

An increased amount of cream in the finished cheese makes for a well-balanced acidity and decadent texture, perfect to serve with Maggie's Quince or Spiced Pear Paste.Maggie's tips for a perfect platter:1. Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled. All that's left is to open a bottle of your favourite wine or non-alcoholic, sit back and enjoy!  - Australian owned- Australian made- 100% Australian milk & cream","wwItemIngredients":"Pasteurised Milk (min. 14.0% Cream), Salt, Starter Cultures, Non-Animal Rennet"},{"wwItemTitle":"Leggos Fresh Bolognese Sauce 250g","wwItemDetails":"Leggos Fresh Beef Bolognese Sauce with tomato  Italian herbs Serves 2 Ready in 3 mins No artificial colours or flavours","wwItemIngredients":"Diced tomato (28%), water, tomato paste (16%), beef (13%), onion (6%), carrot, olive oil, brown sugar, cornflour, parmesan cheese (contains milk), yeast extract, salt, garlic, herbs, food acid (citric), black pepper"},{"wwItemTitle":"Tasmanian Pate Smoked Salmon & Cracked Pepper Pate 130g","wwItemDetails":"Why have one pate when you can have two?

Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled.
