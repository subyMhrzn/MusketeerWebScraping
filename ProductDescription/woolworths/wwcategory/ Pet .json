Parasites such as fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm pose a challenge to most Australian pets. Your pet is an important part of your life and looking after their day to day health is a big priority. EXELPET™ products offer a comprehensive range of convenient and effective solutions designed to eliminate and prevent fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm.The key to effective flea control is starting early, before adult numbers build up. For effective control, we recommend using EXELPET™ flea prevention regularly, all year round. Some products will kill adult fleas, while some prevent the development of larvae or the production of viable flea eggs. EXELPET™ products provide a comprehensive range of solutions to help provide protection from all four stages of the flea lifecycle.Because most of a flea’s life is spent in the environment and not on your pet, good flea management programs also involve attending to your dog or cat’s environment. Washing bedding, blankets and pillows in hot water (>60C) as well as cleaning up or fencing off dusty or sandy areas outdoors where your pet spends time.Intestinal worms affect thousands of Australian pets every year. Untreated, intestinal worms present a significant health risk to you and your pet. The good news is that keeping your pets free from intestinal parasites is easy. EXELPET™ worming products provide broad spectrum and simple to use treatment from intestinal parasites for your pet. Intestinal worming is recommended at least 3 monthly in your adult pet. Pets fed or potentially able to access offal require intestinal worming every 6 weeks.EXELPET Vet Series Monthly Flea, Intestinal & Heartworm Treatment for dogs over 25kg.-ONCE A MONTH FLEA & WORM TREATMENT-STOPS FLEAS FEEDING IN 3-5 MINUTES-PREVENTS HEARTWORM-CONTROLS INTESTINAL WORMS & LARVAE","wwItemIngredients":"null"},{"wwItemTitle":"Dine Classic Collection In Jelly Fish Selection 85g X12 Pack","wwItemDetails":"","wwItemIngredients":"Meat Selected From Chicken; Binder (from sheep); T,apioca starch; Gelling Agents; Flavours; Vegetable, Fibre; Vitamins and Minerals; Salt; Colouring Agents; Taurine.

Parasites such as fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm pose a challenge to most Australian pets. Your pet is an important part of your life and looking after their day to day health is a big priority. EXELPET™ products offer a comprehensive range of convenient and effective solutions designed to eliminate and prevent fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm.The key to effective flea control is starting early, before adult numbers build up. For effective control, we recommend using EXELPET™ flea prevention regularly, all year round. Some products will kill adult fleas, while some prevent the development of larvae or the production of viable flea eggs. EXELPET™ products provide a comprehensive range of solutions to help provide protection from all four stages of the flea lifecycle.Because most of a flea’s life is spent in the environment and not on your pet, good flea management programs also involve attending to your dog or cat’s environment. Washing bedding, blankets and pillows in hot water (>60C) as well as cleaning up or fencing off dusty or sandy areas outdoors where your pet spends time.Intestinal worms affect thousands of Australian pets every year. Untreated, intestinal worms present a significant health risk to you and your pet. The good news is that keeping your pets free from intestinal parasites is easy. EXELPET™ worming products provide broad spectrum and simple to use treatment from intestinal parasites for your pet. Intestinal worming is recommended at least 3 monthly in your adult pet.

Your pet is an important part of your life and looking after their day to day health is a big priority. EXELPET™ products offer a comprehensive range of convenient and effective solutions designed to eliminate and prevent fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm.The key to effective flea control is starting early, before adult numbers build up. For effective control, we recommend using EXELPET™ flea prevention regularly, all year round. Some products will kill adult fleas, while some prevent the development of larvae or the production of viable flea eggs. EXELPET™ products provide a comprehensive range of solutions to help provide protection from all four stages of the flea lifecycle.Because most of a flea’s life is spent in the environment and not on your pet, good flea management programs also involve attending to your dog or cat’s environment. Washing bedding, blankets and pillows in hot water (>60C) as well as cleaning up or fencing off dusty or sandy areas outdoors where your pet spends time.Intestinal worms affect thousands of Australian pets every year. Untreated, intestinal worms present a significant health risk to you and your pet. The good news is that keeping your pets free from intestinal parasites is easy.

The pH balance is different and is also thinner than human skin, so use of human shampoo on your dog is not recommended. You should always use a shampoo specifically formulated for your pet’s skin. You should not need to shampoo your dog more than once a fortnight. This lets the natural oils in your dog's coat and skin do their work. You should not wash your dog for at least 48 hours after a spot-on or line flea treatment.

Grooming helps stimulate your pet’s skin and coat promoting healthy growth and also removes excess hair and debris. This helps your pet keep a glossy coat and can also reduce shedding around your home. Regular grooming sessions also give you the chance to thoroughly check your pet's skin and coat for irritation and parasites such as fleas and ticks.How to use:1. Shake well before use. Thoroughly soak coat and work in the lather right down to the dog's skin. Avoid contact with the dog's face, eyes and ears. 2. After five to ten minutes rinse and dry. 3. Repeat as often as necessary to keep your dog's coat and skin looking healthy. If itching and soreness occurs seek veterinary advice.4.

Being medicated it is Anti-Bacterial and Anti-Fungal and can give the dog relief from itching. A pet’s skin is different to your own. The pH balance is different and is also thinner than human skin, so use of human shampoo on your dog is not recommended. You should always use a shampoo specifically formulated for your pet’s skin. You should not need to shampoo your dog more than once a fortnight. This lets the natural oils in your dog's coat and skin do their work. You should not wash your dog for at least 48 hours after a spot-on or line flea treatment. Aside from keeping your pet looking great, regular grooming provides health benefits for both you and your pet. Grooming helps stimulate your pet’s skin and coat promoting healthy growth and also removes excess hair and debris. This helps your pet keep a glossy coat and can also reduce shedding around your home. Regular grooming sessions also give you the chance to thoroughly check your pet's skin and coat for irritation and parasites such as fleas and ticks.How to use:1. Shake well before use. Thoroughly soak coat and work in the lather right down to the dog's skin. Avoid contact with the dog's face, eyes and ears. 2. After five to ten minutes rinse and dry. 3. Repeat as often as necessary to keep your dog's coat and skin looking healthy. If itching and soreness occurs seek veterinary advice.4. It is also recommended you use a dog brush or comb to remove tangles, knots and loose hair from your dog's coat after washing.Contraindications: This product is not recommended for use in puppies less than 12 weeks of age.Anti-bacterial & Anti-fungalAssists the relief of Dermatoses, Eczema and Dry SkinRelief from itching100% HDPE Recyclable Bottle & PP LidMade in Australia","wwItemIngredients":"Active Constituents: Salicylic Acid 4mgmL and Tri,closan 5mgmL Treatment is both anti-bacterial and,anti-fungal."},{"wwItemTitle":"Bark Gym Squeakers Dog Toy Each","wwItemDetails":"","wwItemIngredients":"null"},{"wwItemTitle":"Bark Barker's Dozen Donuts Dog Toy Each","wwItemDetails":"","wwItemIngredients":"null"},{"wwItemTitle":"Enhance Supernutrition Probiotic Calcium Drops 50g","wwItemDetails":"","wwItemIngredients":"null"},{"wwItemTitle":"The Pet Cartel Feather Teaser Cat Toy Each","wwItemDetails":"The Pet Cartel's Feather Teaser Wand lets you play with your cat and bring out the fully grown hunter in them.
